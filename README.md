DESCRIPTION OF TASK
# Task 2: Deep Learning Image Classification

This project demonstrates a deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Overview

We use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to achieve high accuracy in image classification. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which contains 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0â€“9).

### Technologies Used:
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Matplotlib

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow matplotlib
